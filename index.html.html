            <p><h3>In our college, the Department of Statistics was started in 2014. The Department has a vibrant STAT Association that promotes students' interest in the subject by organizing activities with their enthusiastic participation. All these events are aimed at encouraging the students to explore beyond the frontiers of the prescribed syllabus, evaluate critical statistical issues, and interact with experts from manifold areas in the field of statistics. The main goal of the department is to impart quality education and promote theoretical, computational, and applied knowledge in the subjects of statistics, which enables the students to pursue their future careers either in the academic field, insurance firms, or broadly in the analytics industry. The department conducts day observations every year. National Statistics Day celebrates on June 29 every year. Departments host seminars, institutional visits, talks by experts, and quizzes. The department aims to train students in the development and applications of statistical techniques for analyzing data arising in the scientific investigation of problems in various disciplines. It also provides first-hand practical experience in handling modern statistical software in the analysis of such data. The successful students in degree courses are directed to either higher studies at various universities/national institutions/colleges or jobs.</h3></p>
